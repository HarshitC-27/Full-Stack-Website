# Full-Stack-Website

To run the website, download the code from the zip file and then navigate to the folder containing the front end and the back end folders.

Then start the backend server as follows

`cd Back End`

`npm install`

`nodemon app`

This should start the server at port 5001 of your localhost. The next step is to run the code for the front end.

In another terminal window, do the following

`cd Front End`

`npm install`

`npm start`

This should open the front end at localhost 3000 of your system, thus you must be able to run the full stack app.
